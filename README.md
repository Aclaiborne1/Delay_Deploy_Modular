Note that all of these files must be in the same folder.  That folder should be in the same folder that holds your
other sketch folders.  Name that folder Delay_Deploy_Modular.  It should contain:
  Delay_Deploy_Modular.ino; 
  Menu.h; 
  Menu.ino;  
  Rocket.h; 
  Rocket.ino; 
  Storage_Modules.h; 
  Storage_Modules.ino.
  
When you open the program Delay_Deploy_Modular.ino in your Arduino IDE, the other programs should load along with it automatically.
